# SACNR Monitor Announce API (BETA)

From: http://monitor.sacnr.com/api.html

If you are having trouble getting your server on the internet list but you still want it to show up on SACNR Monitor, you can do this by installing the SACNR Monitor Announce Filterscript - just follow the steps below.

 - Download the filterscript and save as "announce.pwn"
 - Compile the .pwn file using PAWNO, and it will create an "announce.amx" file
 - Copy/paste "announce.amx" into your "filterscripts" folder
 - Add "announce" to the filterscripts line in your server.cfg
